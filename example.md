# Example Markdown Document

This is a paragraph with multiple sentences in a single line. Each sentence should be split. And exclamations work too! Questions? Yes, they work as well.

## Code Blocks Preserved

Here's a code example:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This has periods. But it's code.
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let x = 3.14; // floating point
}
```

The code above is preserved exactly as written. No reformatting happens inside code blocks.

## Lists Work Great

* First list item with one sentence.
* Second item. This has two sentences.
* Third item!

Numbered lists also work:

1. First numbered item. With multiple sentences.
2. Second numbered item.

## Tables Are Preserved

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1.1 | Data 1.2 | More. |
| Data 2.1 | Data 2.2 | Values. |

The table above remains unchanged. No sentence splitting happens in tables.

## More Features

This tool handles various edge cases. It recognizes abbreviations like Dr. Smith and Mr. Jones (though simple ones). It also handles numbers like 3.14 correctly.

    Indented code blocks are preserved.
    They can contain periods. And sentences.
    But no reformatting occurs.

> Blockquotes are also preserved.
> They maintain their structure.

That's all! The tool is ready to use.
